Coding Task: Fetch and display Users Data in a Table

Create and initialize a new angular project with cli 
with routing and prime-ng library. 
Here is the link https://www.npmjs.com/package/primeng. 

You have to use Prime-ng Library to build a table. 
Here is the link https://www.primefaces.org/primeng/#/table.

Create a parent component Users that will show all users 
in a prime-ng table. The columns can be id, name, email, city 
and phone. 

Allow sorting of each column. 

Clicking on any user in table will navigate to the individual 
user details view. 
Use a user-details component that displays individual 
user details.

The mock data should be consumed via a service. 

There is an api available for collection of users at 
http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users. 

Custom styling and unit tests are nice to have but optional.
